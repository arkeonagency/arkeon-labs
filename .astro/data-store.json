You can write the same sentence in two different fonts, and it will mean two different things.\n\n*   *Written in Times New Roman:* It feels academic, serious, perhaps a bit dated.\n*   *Written in Courier:* It feels technical, raw, unfinished.\n*   *Written in Comic Sans:* It feels like a joke.\n\nAt Arkeon, we treat typography as the primary visual element. We use **Recoleta** for headings to whisper elegance, heritage, and warmth, while utilizing **Inter** for body text to speak with modern, clean efficiency.\n\n### Readability vs. Legibility\n\nThere is a difference between being able to see letters (legibility) and wanting to read them (readability).\n\nWe obsess over:\n*   **Line Height:** Too tight, and the text feels cramped. Too loose, and the eye gets lost.\n*   **Line Length:** A line of text should be between 45 and 75 characters. Any longer, and the user's eye gets tired tracking back to the start of the next line.\n*   **Contrast:** Grey text on a white background might look \"aesthetic,\" but if it strains the eye, it fails.\n\n### Macro and Micro Typography\n\n**Macro typography** is the overall structure—how headlines interact with paragraphs and whitespace. This guides the user down the page.\n\n**Micro typography** is the detail—kerning (space between letters), ligatures, and using real quote marks (“”) instead of inch marks (\").\n\nThese details are invisible to the average user, but they feel the difference.

The \"Sticky\" Add-to-Cart\nOn mobile, the \"Add to Cart\" button should never leave the screen. As the user scrolls down to read the description or reviews, the button should stick to the bottom of the viewport.\n\n## 2. Guest Checkout by Default\nForcing a user to create an account before buying is the #1 reason for cart abandonment. Allow them to buy as a guest, and *then* ask them to save their details for next time on the \"Thank You\" page.\n\n## 3. Visual Trust Signals\nUsers don't read; they scan.

It is crowded, loud, and stuffed with inventory.\n\n**Web design works the exact same way.**\n\n## The Role of White Space\nIn digital design, white space (negative space) is not empty; it is active. It directs the eye. It signals confidence. A brand that crams every pixel with information screams \"desperation.\" A brand that uses generous padding screams \"authority.\"\n\n## Typography as Voice\nTypeface selection is the voice of your brand.\n*   **Serifs (like Recoleta):** Evoke history, trust, and elegance.\n*   **Sans Serifs (like Inter):** Evoke modernity, efficiency, and clarity.\n*   **The Mix:** Arkeon's strategy often involves pairing a character-rich serif header with a utilitarian sans-serif body.\n\n## Micro-Interactions\nLuxury is in the details.

They include code for a portfolio, a shop, a blog, a forum, and a gallery—even if you only need a landing page.\n*   **The Result:** Your user downloads 5MB of useless Javascript before seeing your headline.\n*   **The Fix:** Custom architecture (like Astro) loads only what is needed.\n\n## The Brand Ceiling\nA template imposes its personality on your brand. You can change colors and fonts, but the *structure* remains generic. In a crowded market, \"generic\" is the kiss of death. Premium brands are defined by their uniqueness.\n\n## The 3-Year Rebuild Cycle\nMost startups using templates have to rebuild their entire site every 18 months because the code becomes unmanageable.

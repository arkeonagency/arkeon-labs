# The Trap of "Good Enough"

In the early days of a startup, speed is everything. You buy a $59 ThemeForest template, install a few plugins, and launch. It looks decent. It works. For now. But as your traffic grows, you start to notice the cracks. The site takes 4 seconds to load. Your bounce rate creeps up to 60%.

This is the hidden cost of templates: **Technical Debt.**

## The Speed Penalty
Templates are built to sell to everyone. They include code for a portfolio, a shop, a blog, a forum, and a gallery—even if you only need a landing page.
*   **The Result:** Your user downloads 5MB of useless Javascript before seeing your headline.
*   **The Fix:** Custom architecture (like Astro) loads only what is needed.

## The Brand Ceiling
A template imposes its personality on your brand. You can change colors and fonts, but the *structure* remains generic. In a crowded market, "generic" is the kiss of death. Premium brands are defined by their uniqueness.

## The 3-Year Rebuild Cycle
Most startups using templates have to rebuild their entire site every 18 months because the code becomes unmanageable. By building custom from Day 1, you create a modular system that grows with you for 5+ years.

## The Hero's Journey

Most businesses make the mistake of making themselves the hero of the story. "We are great," "We have awards," "We are founded in 2010."

The truth is: **The customer does not care about you.** They care about themselves.

At Arkeon, we use the StoryBrand framework to structure every website we build. In this story:
1.  **The User is the Hero.**
2.  **The User has a Problem** (The Villain).
3.  **You are the Guide** (like Yoda or Gandalf).
4.  **You give them a Plan.**
5.  **You call them to Action.**

### Architecture follows Narrative

We do not start with a Sitemap; we start with a script. Before we design a wireframe, we answer: "What is the transformation we are offering?"

For example, for a dental client, the transformation isn't "getting a root canal." It's "reclaiming confidence and being pain-free."

### The structure of a High-Converting Page

1.  **The Hook (Hero Section):** State the transformation clearly. "Design at the Origin of Greatness."
2.  **The Problem (Agitation):** "Generic websites are costing you clients."
3.  **The Solution (The Guide):** "We craft story-driven experiences."
4.  **The Proof (Authority):** Case studies and testimonials.
5.  **The CTA (Climax):** "Start your project."

When code follows story, the website stops being a brochure and starts being a sales engine.

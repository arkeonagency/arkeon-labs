## The Voice of the Brand

If photography is the face of your website, typography is its voice. You can write the same sentence in two different fonts, and it will mean two different things.

*   *Written in Times New Roman:* It feels academic, serious, perhaps a bit dated.
*   *Written in Courier:* It feels technical, raw, unfinished.
*   *Written in Comic Sans:* It feels like a joke.

At Arkeon, we treat typography as the primary visual element. We use **Recoleta** for headings to whisper elegance, heritage, and warmth, while utilizing **Inter** for body text to speak with modern, clean efficiency.

### Readability vs. Legibility

There is a difference between being able to see letters (legibility) and wanting to read them (readability).

We obsess over:
*   **Line Height:** Too tight, and the text feels cramped. Too loose, and the eye gets lost.
*   **Line Length:** A line of text should be between 45 and 75 characters. Any longer, and the user's eye gets tired tracking back to the start of the next line.
*   **Contrast:** Grey text on a white background might look "aesthetic," but if it strains the eye, it fails.

### Macro and Micro Typography

**Macro typography** is the overall structure—how headlines interact with paragraphs and whitespace. This guides the user down the page.

**Micro typography** is the detail—kerning (space between letters), ligatures, and using real quote marks (“”) instead of inch marks (").

These details are invisible to the average user, but they feel the difference. They create a texture of quality that elevates the brand from "good enough" to "premium."

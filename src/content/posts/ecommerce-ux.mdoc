# The One-Click Rule

The golden rule of e-commerce is simple: **Friction Kills Conversion.** Every millisecond of load time, every extra form field, every confusing button reduces your revenue by 1-5%.

## 1. The "Sticky" Add-to-Cart
On mobile, the "Add to Cart" button should never leave the screen. As the user scrolls down to read the description or reviews, the button should stick to the bottom of the viewport.

## 2. Guest Checkout by Default
Forcing a user to create an account before buying is the #1 reason for cart abandonment. Allow them to buy as a guest, and *then* ask them to save their details for next time on the "Thank You" page.

## 3. Visual Trust Signals
Users don't read; they scan. They are looking for visual cues that say "Safe."
*   Payment icons (Visa/Mastercard) near the checkout button.
*   "Secure Checkout" padlock icons.

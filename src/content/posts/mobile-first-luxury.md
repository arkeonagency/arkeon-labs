## The Constraint is the Canvas

Luxury often implies space, scale, and grandeur. On a 27-inch iMac, we can use massive images and intricate grids to convey this. But what happens when that canvas shrinks to a 6-inch iPhone screen?

Many agencies simply stack the content vertically and call it a day. The result is a boring, endless scroll.

### Designing for the Thumb

Mobile luxury is about **feel**. Since the user is physically touching the interface, the tactile feedback is critical.

*   **Buttons** must be sized for thumbs (minimum 44px height), but styled elegantly.
*   **Animations** must run at 60fps. A jittery animation feels like a cheap car door rattling when you shut it.
*   **Navigation** must be accessible at the bottom or easily reachable, respecting the "Thumb Zone."

### The Art of the Reveal

On mobile, we use "progressive disclosure." We don't show everything at once. We use horizontal scrolls, accordions, and modal windows to keep the interface clean while keeping deep content accessible.

### Haptics and Micro-Interactions

We are beginning to experiment with the Vibration API. Imagine a subtle, tiny vibration when a user completes a form or clicks a primary button. These are sensory details that elevate a digital experience from "software" to "crafted object."

Mobile is not a downgrade. It is a different medium with its own rules for luxury.

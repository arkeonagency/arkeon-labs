# The Monolith is Dead

For 20 years, the web was ruled by the "Monolith"—systems like WordPress where the database, the admin panel, and the frontend display were all mashed into one server. If the server went down, your site died.

## Enter the Headless Revolution
"Headless" means chopping off the front end.
1.  **The Body (Content):** Lives in a secure API (Sanity, Keystatic).
2.  **The Head (Display):** Is built with modern frameworks (React, Astro) and deployed to a global CDN.

## Why This Matters for Business
*   **Security:** There is no database to hack on the public website.
*   **Omnichannel:** Your content lives in the cloud. You can push that same content to your Website, your Mobile App, and your Smart Watch app simultaneously.
*   **Performance:** Because the site is pre-built, there is no database query time.

# The Leapfrog Effect

Ethiopia is not following the Western path of digital adoption; it is leapfrogging it. We moved from no phones to smartphones. We are moving from cash to Telebirr instantly. This speed of adoption means consumer expectations are changing faster than businesses can keep up.

## The "Telegram First" Mentality
In Ethiopia, the internet is synonymous with Telegram. But a Telegram channel is not a brand. It is a feed.
*   **The Problem:** Telegram content disappears. It isn't searchable on Google.
*   **The Solution:** Use Telegram for distribution, but use a **Website** for conversion. Your site is your HQ.

## Mobile Data Constraints
Local web design must respect the user's data plan. Heavy videos and unoptimized images are disrespectful to the Ethiopian user. Arkeon's specialized compression ensures your site looks premium but loads with minimal data usage.

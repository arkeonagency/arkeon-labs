## The Problem
Aman Dental needed a website that communicated trust, cleanliness, and patient comfort. Their existing site felt clinical and dated, failing to convert appointment requests effectively.

## The Strategy
We focused on building a calm, minimal interface with warm photography and clear calls-to-action (CTAs). The goal was to create a story-first homepage that walks a potential patient through the experience before they even book, alleviating dental anxiety.

## Execution
- **Refreshed Brand:** Created a palette using calming Teals and Soft Whites.
- **Typography:** Selected a clean, readable hierarchy to ensure accessibility for all ages.
- **Booking Flow:** Streamlined the appointment request process to reduce drop-off.
- **Mobile First:** Ensured the experience was flawless on phones, where 80% of their traffic originates.

## Outcome
The new digital presence has positioned Aman Dental as a modern leader in local healthcare, resulting in a significant increase in online bookings.

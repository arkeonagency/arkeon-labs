## The Challenge
To push the boundaries of what is possible in a standard browser without compromising performance. This project served as a playground for scroll-linked animations and WebGL experiments.

## The Execution
We utilized Astro for a zero-javascript initial load, hydrating only the interactive islands built with React and Framer Motion. 

- **Tech Stack:** Astro, React, Three.js
- **Performance:** Achieved a 100/100 Lighthouse score despite heavy visuals.
- **Interaction:** Custom cursor physics and smooth-scroll implementations.

## Outcome
This project demonstrates that high-end visuals do not have to come at the cost of web performance or SEO.

## The Problem
NOURA launched with great products but a generic visual identity. They needed a digital flagship that felt as premium and organic as the ingredients they use.

## The Strategy
We employed a strategy of "Premium Minimalism." Large, breathing whitespace, elegant serif typography, and high-fidelity texture shots of the creams and oils to evoke sensory feelings through the screen.

## Execution
We built a custom Shopify theme that prioritizes storytelling over standard grid listings. Each product page functions as a mini-landing page, educating the user on the ingredients and benefits before asking for the sale.

## Outcome
A cohesive brand system that successfully launched their new "Midnight" collection, resulting in a 40% increase in average cart value compared to their previous platform.
